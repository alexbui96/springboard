Write a summary of the exploratory data analysis above. 
What numerical or categorical features were in the data?




Was there any pattern suggested of a relationship between state and ticket price?


What did this lead us to decide regarding which features to use in subsequent modeling? 

What aspects of the data (e.g. relationships between features) should you remain wary of when you come to perform feature selection for modeling? 

Two key points that must be addressed are the choice of target feature for your modelling and how, if at all, you're going to handle the states labels in the data.


In this session, there are two main datasets of the skiing resorts and fifty-state geographic information used for analysis, such as the state's population, total area, number

of resorts, skiable area, night skiing area, total open days, resort density at each state, etc. Looking at the top five in general, the area of skiing available at night

are all the more northerly states. The total days open seem to bear some resemblance to the number of resorts in Corolado. There are states that host many resorts, but other 

states host a larger total skiing area. The states with the most total days skiing per season are not necessarily those with the most resorts. New York State boasts an 

especially large night skiing area. New York had the most resorts but wasn't in the top five largest states. New York has the second largest population behind California.

It show an interesting views of normalizing the number of resorts per 100k squared miles and 100k population at each state. Vermont seems particularly high in terms of resorts

per capita, and both New Hampshire and Vermont top the chart for resorts per area. The process of scaling state dataset came out as expected, e.g. the mean of all feautures are

pretty much zeros, and the standard deviation is one for all features.
